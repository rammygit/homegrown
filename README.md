Simple static website for my blog with markdown support

This is from an idea that I am missing in current static site generator. Yes they build fast but it comes with so much bells and whistles. 
Intent is to have the end-user checkout and run a command `npm start` ( yes I am using node.js), they should have the blog up and running.

Local developer setup is something that interests me. Current static site generators largely ignore them.
