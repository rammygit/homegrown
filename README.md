Simple static website for my blog with markdown support

This is from an idea that I am missing in current static site generator. Yes they build fast but it comes with so much bells and whistles. 
Intent is to have the end-user checkout and run a command `npm start` ( yes I am using node.js), they should have the blog up and running.

Local developer setup is something that interests me. Current static site generators largely ignore them. 

Project is largely in development. With lot of features I plan to add. Top 2 items 

1. Search 
2. Themes as branch


### For Developers

You start at build.js

You can see this in action @ [staticfire.site](https://www.staticfire.site)
