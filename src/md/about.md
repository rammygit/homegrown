## About

 I wrote this basic static web site for my own learning. If you find any vulnerability please notify me.
 Written using nodeJS. Thinking to rewrite this in some quick build system but I am personally fine with the build speed. Yet to test with huge markdown files. 



Roadmap: 
- Adding comments.-> probably discus. not sure if there is anything better than this. let me know. 

- Better landing page. (not that important per say)

- Need better post layouts. Look for `pages/post.html`
